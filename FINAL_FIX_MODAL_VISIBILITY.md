# ✅ FINAL FIX: Modal Form Now Visible!

## 🎯 THE ISSUE YOU REPORTED

After I fixed the map clicking issue, the **Report Incident form disappeared!** You could click on the map but couldn't see the form to fill out incident details.

## 🔧 WHAT WAS WRONG

When I made the modal transparent to allow map clicks, I accidentally made the **entire modal invisible** including the form. Oops! 😅

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

I repositioned the modal to appear as a **side panel on the right** while keeping the map fully clickable on the left!

### What I Changed:

1. **Modal Position** - Changed from center to right side
   ```css
   .modal {
     right: 0; /* Stick to right side */
     width: auto; /* Not full width */
     padding: 20px;
   }
   ```

2. **Modal Form** - Fixed width, slides in from right
   ```css
   .modal-content {
     width: 450px; /* Fixed width */
     animation: slideInRight; /* Slides in from right */
   }
   ```

3. **Backdrop** - More visible dark overlay
   ```css
   .modal-backdrop {
     background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4); /* Darker */
   }
   ```
