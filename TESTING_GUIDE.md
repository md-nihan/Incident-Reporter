## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Map doesn't load
**Solution**: Check Geoapify API key in .env file

### Issue: Incidents don't save
**Solution**: Verify MongoDB connection in server logs

### Issue: Real-time updates not working
**Solution**: Check browser console for Socket.IO errors

### Issue: Geolocation fails
**Solution**: Use HTTPS or localhost, check browser permissions
