# ✅ FEATURE ADDED: Remove/Resolve Incidents

## 🎯 NEW FEATURE

Users can now **mark incidents as resolved** when the problem is fixed! This removes the incident from the map for everyone.

## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS

### When You Click on Any Incident Marker:

The popup now shows **TWO buttons**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 🚗 Traffic Jam              │
│                             │
│ Heavy traffic on main road  │
│                             │
│ 📍 Location details         │
│ ⏰ Time posted              │
│                             │
│ ✅ 5 confirmations          │
│                             │
│ ┌──────────┐ ┌────────────┐│
│ │👍 Confirm│ │✅ Resolved ││
│ └──────────┘ └────────────┘│
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Two Actions:**
1. **Confirm** (Green) - "I also see this problem"
2. **Problem Resolved** (Blue) - "Problem is fixed, remove it"

## 🎬 USER FLOW

### Scenario: Traffic jam is cleared

1. **User clicks on traffic jam marker**
2. **Sees popup with incident details**
3. **Traffic is now clear, so clicks "Problem Resolved"**
4. **Confirmation dialog appears:**
   ```
   Mark this incident as resolved?
   This will remove it from the map.
   
   [Cancel]  [OK]
   ```
5. **User clicks OK**
6. **Incident is removed:**
   - ✅ Marker disappears from map
   - ✅ Removed for ALL users in real-time
   - ✅ Toast: "✅ Problem resolved! Incident removed."
   - ✅ Incident count decreases

## 🔄 REAL-TIME UPDATES

When someone resolves an incident:
- **Their screen**: Marker disappears immediately
- **Other users**: Marker disappears in real-time (Socket.IO)
- **Database**: Incident marked as inactive
- **Everyone sees**: Updated incident count

## 🎨 VISUAL DESIGN

### Popup Actions (Side by Side):

```css
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Green Button │ Blue Button  │
│  👍 Confirm  │ ✅ Resolved  │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Green Button (Confirm):**
- Icon: 👍 thumbs up
- Text: "Confirm"
- Action: Increase confirmation count
- Use when: You also see this problem

**Blue Button (Problem Resolved):**
- Icon: ✅ check-double
- Text: "Problem Resolved"
- Action: Remove incident from map
- Use when: Problem is fixed

## 📊 BUTTON COMPARISON

| Button | Color | Icon | Action | When to Use |
|--------|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Confirm** | Green | 👍 | +1 confirmation | Problem still exists |
| **Resolved** | Blue | ✅ | Remove incident | Problem is fixed |

## 💻 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Frontend (script.js):

```javascript
// New function added
async function resolveIncident(incidentId) {
    // Show confirmation dialog
    if (!confirm('Mark this incident as resolved?...')) {
        return;
    }
    
    // DELETE request to server
    const response = await fetch(`/api/incidents/${incidentId}`, {
        method: 'DELETE'
    });
    
    // Show success message
    showToast('✅ Problem resolved!', 'success');
}
```

### Backend (routes/incidents.js):

The DELETE endpoint already exists:
```javascript
DELETE /api/incidents/:id
- Marks incident as inactive (isActive: false)
- Emits Socket.IO event: 'incident-removed'
- Returns success response
```

### Socket.IO Event:

```javascript
socket.on('incident-removed', (data) => {
    // Remove marker from map
    removeIncidentMarker(data.id);
    // Update stats
    updateStats();
});
```
