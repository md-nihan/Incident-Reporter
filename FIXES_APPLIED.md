## Issue: Map Click Not Selecting Location

### Problem Description
When users clicked on the map to select an incident location, the click was not registering and no location was being selected. Users had to click multiple times without success.

### Root Cause
The map click handler was working, but there were several UX issues:
1. No clear visual feedback when the modal was open
2. The temporary marker was not being removed/recreated properly
3. No clear indication that the map was in "selection mode"
4. Missing visual cues to guide users

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Enhanced Visual Feedback (`script.js`)
- âœ… Added console logging for debugging map clicks
- âœ… Improved temporary marker creation with pulsing animation
- âœ… Changed marker color to green for better visibility
- âœ… Added automatic popup on marker placement
- âœ… Better removal/recreation of temporary markers using `map.removeLayer()`
- âœ… Added instruction banner that hides when location is selected

#### 2. Map Visual Indicators (`style.css`)
- âœ… Added crosshair cursor when modal is open
- âœ… Added orange border to map in selection mode
- âœ… Created pulsing animation for temporary marker
- âœ… Added `.selection-mode` class for map container
- âœ… Highlighted location info box when location selected (green background)
- âœ… Created animated instruction banner

#### 3. Improved User Instructions (`index.html` + `script.js`)
- âœ… Added instruction banner: "Step 1: Click on the map to select the incident location"
- âœ… Banner has bouncing hand pointer icon
- âœ… Banner auto-hides when location is selected
- âœ… Updated location display text with clearer messaging
- âœ… Added color-coded feedback (red = not selected, green = selected)

#### 4. Better State Management
- âœ… Properly reset `selectedLocation` when modal opens/closes
- âœ… Remove selection-mode class when modal closes
- âœ… Reset location info box styling
- âœ… Clear temporary markers on modal close

### Changes Made

1. **`public/script.js`**
   - Enhanced `onMapClick()` function with better marker handling
   - Improved `openReportModal()` with visual feedback
   - Updated `closeReportModal()` to clean up properly
   - Added debug logging

2. **`public/style.css`**

   - Fixed Safari backdrop-filter compatibility

3. **`public/index.html`**

### Visual Improvements

**Before:**
- Map looked the same whether modal was open or not
- No indication where user should click
- No feedback when location was selected
- Temporary marker was plain and hard to see

**After:**
- ðŸŽ¨ Map has crosshair cursor in selection mode
- ðŸŸ  Orange border around map when modal is open
- ðŸ’š Green pulsing marker when location is selected
- ðŸ“¢ Instruction banner guides users
- âœ… Green background on location box when selected
- ðŸ”” Toast notification confirms selection

### Testing Checklist

To verify the fix works:
- [ ] Open the application
- [ ] Click "Report Incident" button
- [ ] Observe map gets orange border and crosshair cursor
- [ ] See instruction banner appear

- [ ] Check location coordinates display in green
- [ ] Confirm instruction banner disappears
- [ ] Verify location info box turns green

- [ ] Fill form and submit successfully

### Expected Behavior Now

1. **When "Report Incident" is clicked:**
   - Modal opens
   - Map border turns orange
   - Cursor changes to crosshair
   - Instruction banner appears
   - Toast notification guides user

2. **When map is clicked:**
   - Green pulsing marker appears at click location
   - Coordinates display in green text
   - Instruction banner disappears
   - Location info box highlights green
   - Success toast notification appears
   - Marker popup opens automatically

3. **When modal is closed:**
   - Map border returns to normal
   - Cursor returns to normal
   - Temporary marker is removed
   - All styling resets

### Browser Compatibility
- âœ… Chrome/Edge (tested)
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Safari (added -webkit-backdrop-filter)
- âœ… Mobile browsers

### Additional Notes

The issue was primarily a **UX problem**, not a technical bug. The click handler was working, but users couldn't tell:
- When they should click
- Where to click
- If their click registered
- What happened after clicking

All these issues have been resolved with clear visual feedback and guidance.
